Thank you for the comprehensive summary of DiveTribe. Everything looks well thought-out. To move forward, here are a few suggestions and clarifying questions—especially around security and implementation details—so we can begin designing the system architecture and data flows:

1.  System Architecture & Data Flow
    •  Draw a high-level diagram showing mobile clients, API gateway, Supabase backend, third-party integrations (Garmin, Maps, AI).  
    •  Define network boundaries and trust zones (mobile app, public internet, private backend).  
    •  Map out data flows for critical use cases (dive sync, feed fetch, challenge join, profile export/deletion).

2.  Authentication & Authorization
    •  Confirm which endpoints require roles:  
       –  “User” vs. “Business” vs. “Admin.”  
       –  Which actions are self-service vs. privileged (e.g., challenge creation).
    •  Will we support MFA on login (email/social)? If so, which factors (TOTP, SMS)?
    •  How will JWTs be issued, rotated, and revoked? (Supabase issues JWTs by default—do we need our own refresh tokens?)

3.  API Security & Rate Limiting
    •  Propose using a lightweight API gateway (e.g., Kong, NGINX + Lua) in front of Supabase to enforce:  
       –  TLS termination (TLS 1.2+).  
       –  Rate limiting per IP or per user token.  
       –  CORS allow-list (e.g., only our mobile app’s bundle IDs / URL schemes).  
    •  Plan for standard security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).

4.  Input Validation & Data Sanitization
    •  All server-side endpoints must validate JSON bodies (e.g., Zod schemas or OpenAPI validation).  
    •  Use parameterized queries / Supabase’s built-in RLS (Row Level Security) with `allow` policies.  
    •  Enforce file upload checks (type, size, scan for malware) and store outside webroot — use signed URLs.

5.  Privacy & Compliance
    •  Design a GDPR-style data export/deletion flow:  
       –  “Right to access” (aggregate all PII & dive logs).  
       –  “Right to be forgotten” (anonymize or delete personal data).  
    •  Default dive logs to friends-only; implement privacy toggle with consent recording.

6.  Sensitive Data Protection
    •  Encrypt at rest:  
       –  Supabase database with TDE (Transparent Data Encryption).  
       –  Any object storage (photos, dive computer raw data) with server-side encryption keys.  
    •  Secrets management:  
       –  Store API keys (Garmin, Maps, AI) in a vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).  
       –  Never check secrets into source control.

7.  Monitoring, Logging & Alerting
    •  Centralize logs (auth events, errors, moderation actions) in a SIEM or log aggregator.  
    •  Mask PII in logs; use structured JSON logging.  
    •  Define alerts for anomalous behaviors (e.g., brute-force login attempts, excessive rate-limit hits).

8.  Offline Logging & Sync
    •  Mobile clients store dive entries in an encrypted local database (e.g., SQLite + SQLCipher).  
    •  On reconnect, authenticate and sync delta changes over TLS.

9.  Next Steps
    1.  Finalize the high-level architecture diagram and trust boundary document.  
    2.  Draft an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification with security schemes and RLS policies.  
    3.  Define a CI/CD pipeline that includes SAST, dependency scanning, and automated security tests.  
    4.  Prototype critical flows (login/MFA, dive sync, RLS examples).

Please let me know which area you’d like to tackle first or if you’d prefer a deeper dive into any specific topic (e.g., RLS setup in Supabase, API gateway configuration, CI/CD security).
