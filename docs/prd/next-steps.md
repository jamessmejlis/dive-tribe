# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

This PRD is ready for UI/UX specification creation. Please review the comprehensive requirements, especially the User Interface Design Goals section, and create a detailed front-end specification that captures the ocean-athlete aesthetic and mobile-first experience for freedivers and spearfishers.

## Architect Prompt

This PRD provides the complete foundation for DiveTribe's technical architecture. Please create a comprehensive fullstack architecture document that addresses the React Native + Expo frontend, Supabase backend, Garmin Connect integration, and all the performance, security, and scalability requirements outlined in this PRD. Pay special attention to the offline capabilities, real-time features, and mobile-first design patterns.
