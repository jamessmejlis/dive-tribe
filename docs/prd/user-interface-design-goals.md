# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

DiveTribe delivers a premium, performance-focused mobile experience that feels both community-driven and data-rich. The interface should evoke the precision and passion of freediving - clean, immersive, and purpose-built for ocean athletes who value both achievement and connection.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Mobile-first scrollable feeds** optimized for one-handed use during post-dive sessions
- **Tab-based navigation** with bottom navigation bar for reliable, familiar app navigation
- **Progressive disclosure** of dive analytics - quick overview cards that expand to detailed metrics
- **Context-aware actions** - smart defaults based on location, previous dives, and user patterns
- **Social engagement patterns** familiar from Instagram/Strava but optimized for dive-specific content

## Core Screens and Views

- **Welcome/Onboarding Flow** - Multi-step profile setup with freediving-specific customization
- **Main Feed** - Scrollable dive stories with embedded metrics, photos, and social actions
- **Dive Logging Interface** - Quick manual entry vs. Garmin sync with visual feedback

- **Color palette inspired by ocean depths** - deep blues, aqua highlights, clean whites
- **Typography that suggests precision and adventure** - clear, readable fonts with subtle athletic styling
- **Photography-forward design** showcasing the beauty of freediving while highlighting data
- **Iconography derived from diving equipment and ocean elements** - depth gauges, fins, bubbles, waves
- **Smooth, wave-like animations** for transitions between screens and data loading

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on **iOS and Android mobile apps** with responsive design principles:
