## Top Issues by Priority

**MEDIUM (Should Fix for Quality):**

1. **Add specific MVP success thresholds** (e.g., "50% of users find dive buddy within 30 days")
2. **Define uptime and reliability targets** for production deployment
3. **Specify CI/CD pipeline and environment strategy** beyond development
4. **Add monitoring and alerting requirements** for production operations

**LOW (Nice to Have):**

1. **Data migration strategy** for future user data movements
2. **Disaster recovery procedures** for business continuity
3. **Support escalation procedures** for user issues

## MVP Scope Assessment

- **✅ Excellent scope focus**: Discovery & Matching moved to Epic 3 for faster value delivery
- **✅ True MVP mentality**: Clear separation of Phase 1 vs Phase 2 features
- **✅ Timeline realism**: Epic sequence enables iterative delivery and learning
- **✅ Complexity management**: Stories sized appropriately for AI agent development

## Technical Readiness

- **✅ Clear constraints**: React Native + Supabase stack well-defined
- **✅ Integration risks identified**: Garmin Connect API validation flagged
- **✅ Performance requirements**: Specific targets for mobile experience
- **⚠️ Operational clarity needed**: Deployment environments and monitoring specifics

## Final Decision

**✅ APPROVED FOR NEXT PHASE** - The PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for UX and Architecture phases. Minor operational improvements can be addressed during architecture planning.
