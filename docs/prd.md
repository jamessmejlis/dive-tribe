# DiveTribe Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create the leading mobile social platform for freedivers and spearfishers worldwide
- Provide comprehensive dive tracking and analytics that sync with Garmin dive computers
- Build a trusted community where divers can discover local buddies and certified instructors
- Gamify the diving experience through challenges, achievements, and leaderboards
- Establish sustainable B2B revenue through premium instructor/shop listings
- Launch successfully in key freediving hubs (Bali, Hawaii, Mediterranean) as beachhead markets

### Background Context

The freediving and spearfishing community currently lacks a dedicated social platform that combines performance tracking with meaningful community connection. While generic social media platforms like Instagram showcase beautiful underwater photos, they don't capture the technical aspects that matter to serious divers - depth achievements, breath-hold progress, safety protocols, and skill development.

Existing solutions either focus purely on dive logging (like diving apps) or general social features, but none successfully merge data-driven performance tracking with community-building and local discovery. DiveTribe fills this gap by creating "Strava for the ocean" - where every dive becomes a data-rich story that helps athletes track progress, connect with peers, and stay motivated through shared challenges.
