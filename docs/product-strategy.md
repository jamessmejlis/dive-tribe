## Product Strategies

### Product Development Strategy

Phased Feature Development

- **Phase 1 (MVP - first 6 months):**
  - User profiles, manual logbook, basic social feed, buddy
    search/matching (filter-based)

  - Verified business/instructor listings

  - Event discovery, messaging, incident/safety reporting

  - Monetization: Freemium for advanced logbook & business features

- **Phase 2 (6-18 months):**
  - Garmin/API integration, advanced analytics, AI-driven matching and
    trip recommendations

  - Business marketplace, booking, and escrow payments

  - Social recognition (badges, leaderboards), group/event management
    tools

Technical Feasibility and Risks

- **Garmin/API Integration:** Secure and maintain API partnership; if
  blocked, build manual data import or alternative device connections.

- **AI Matching:** Start with rules/filters—pilot any ML layer with
  opt-in, gather training data after user base scales.

- **Data Privacy and Security:** Minimize PII, follow GDPR, include
  clear consent protocols.

- **Mobile-first Experience:** Native iOS/Android; prioritize
  reliability, local/offline use for field conditions.

UX Priorities

- **Reduce Friction:** Fast onboarding (social sign-in, instant buddy
  search), “get started” checklist, clear value demonstration in \<2
  mins.

- **Delight:** Rich session summaries, visual achievement badges,
  seamless sharing.

- **Safety:** In-app verification, session check-ins, clear reporting
  for incidents/problems.

### Marketing and Sales Strategy

Positioning

- “DiveTribe is your passport to a safer, richer ocean
  adventure—connect, track, share, and grow, anywhere you explore.”

Acquisition Tactics

- Influencer/ambassador seeding in leading ocean cities and resorts

- Launch campaign + field events at major freediving hubs

- Partnerships with gear shops, travel providers, and eco/NGO orgs

Partnership Focus

- Build B2B business case: digital storefronts for instructors, managed
  communities for clubs, cross-promotion with ocean brands.

Regulatory Navigation

- Early legal review (liability waivers, minors, data)

- Clear global consent flows; partnership with local authorities where
  needed

### Customer Success Strategy

- **Onboarding:** Step-by-step in-app guide, first buddy search
  walkthrough, contextual tips

- **Moderation:** Verified user layers, “report” and “review” systems
  for both athletes and businesses

- **Support:** In-app chat, escalation for safety issues, active FAQ

- **Safety:** Incident reporting, safety library, integration with local
  EMS (where possible), nudges for insurance and local regulations

### Open Questions & Alternatives

- How will we handle high-risk or underage user onboarding, especially
  in diverse regions?

- What’s our backup plan if payment regulation for escrow/bookings lags?

- Should we geofence certain features in legally/reputationally
  sensitive countries?

- How do we react if early incident rate or user trust scores lag
  expectations?

### Critical Validation/“Kill Switch” Points

- Failure to achieve \>20% weekly active retention by Month 4 =
  pause/focus on core user value.

- API/partner breakdown: trigger rapid plan switch to
  manual/self-reported logging.

- Trust/safety or legal issue spikes: halt expansion, review processes.

- B2B adoption \<5% target at 9 months: invest in expanded GTM or
  re-evaluate product-market fit for business tools.
