# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **DiveTribe**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

DiveTribe is a mobile-first social platform for freedivers and spearfishers that combines performance tracking with community building - essentially "Strava for the ocean." The architecture must support real-time dive data synchronization, social features, and scalable growth across multiple geographic markets.
