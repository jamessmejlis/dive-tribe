### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form 7.48.x for form validation and management with performance optimization
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (Latest) for media and file storage with S3-compatible API, CDN, and image transformations
- **Device APIs**: Expo Modules (Latest) for native device functionality including Camera, location, contacts integration
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4.x for lightweight state management with simple API and TypeScript support
- **UI Components**: Gluestack UI v2.x for universal, accessible components with built-in form elements

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]

**User Entity Structure:**
- Purpose: Central entity representing divers with profiles, preferences, and authentication
- Key Attributes: id, email, profile (name, bio, certifications, gear), privacy_settings, location, diving_goals
- Database schema: UUID id (PK), string email, JSONB profile, JSONB privacy_settings, geography location, timestamp created_at

**Profile JSONB Structure:**
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  display_name: string
  bio?: string
  avatar_url?: string
  certifications: string[]
  years_experience: number
  diving_goals: string[]
  gear_list: GearItem[]
}

interface GearItem {
  id: string
  name: string
  brand?: string
  category: 'mask' | 'fins' | 'wetsuit' | 'computer' | 'other'
  notes?: string
}
```

### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#project-structure]

**Profile screens location:**
```
app/(tabs)/profile/             # Profile management
├── index.tsx                   # Profile display screen
├── edit.tsx                    # Profile editing screen
└── setup/                      # Profile setup wizard
    ├── welcome.tsx
    ├── basic-info.tsx
    ├── diving-experience.tsx
    ├── gear-list.tsx
    ├── privacy-settings.tsx
    └── location-permissions.tsx
```

**Profile service location:**
```
services/
├── supabase.ts                # Already exists - Supabase client
├── auth.service.ts            # Already exists - Authentication service
└── profile.service.ts         # New - Profile management service
```

**State management location:**
```
stores/
├── auth.store.ts              # Already exists - User authentication store
└── profile.store.ts           # New - User profile store
```

### API Integration

[Source: architecture/api-architecture.md#restful-endpoints]

**Profile Management Endpoints (handled by Supabase):**
```typescript
GET /rest/v1/users?select=profile,privacy_settings - Get user profile
PATCH /rest/v1/users?id=eq.{userId} - Update user profile
POST /storage/v1/object/avatars/{userId} - Upload profile photo
GET /storage/v1/object/public/avatars/{userId} - Get profile photo URL
```

### State Management Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-with-zustand]

**Profile Store Structure:**
```typescript
interface ProfileState {
  profile: UserProfile | null
  loading: boolean
  setupComplete: boolean
  updateProfile: (updates: Partial<UserProfile>) => Promise<void>
  uploadAvatar: (imageUri: string) => Promise<string>
  setPrivacySettings: (settings: PrivacySettings) => Promise<void>
  requestLocationPermission: () => Promise<boolean>
}
```

### UI Component Standards

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-standards]

- Use Gluestack UI v2 components as base building blocks
- Follow ocean-inspired design system with dive blue (#0891b2) for primary actions
- Implement responsive design for mobile-first experience
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance with proper form labels and error handling
- Use centralized constants for colors and spacing
- Profile photo displays should be circular with proper fallback avatars

### File Storage Implementation

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#file-storage]

**Supabase Storage Integration:**
- S3-compatible API for file uploads
- CDN delivery for optimized image loading
- Built-in image transformations for avatar resizing
- Proper file naming conventions: `avatars/{userId}/profile.{extension}`
- File size limits and type validation for security

### Privacy and Security

[Source: architecture/authentication-security.md#privacy-controls]

**Privacy Settings Configuration:**
- Granular Post Visibility: Public, Friends-only, Private (default: friends-only)
- Location Privacy: Optional GPS tagging with location fuzzing
- Profile Privacy: Configurable profile field visibility
- Activity Privacy: Option to hide specific dives or achievements

**Security Measures:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for profile data access
- Input validation and sanitization for all profile fields
- Secure file upload with type and size validation
- Privacy-first defaults for new users

### Form Validation Requirements

**Validation Rules:**
- Display name: Required, 2-50 characters, no special characters except hyphens and apostrophes
- Bio: Optional, max 500 characters
- Certifications: Array of valid certification levels (Open Water, Advanced, Rescue, etc.)
- Years of experience: Number between 0-50
- Diving goals: Array of predefined goal options
- Gear items: Name required, category from predefined list
