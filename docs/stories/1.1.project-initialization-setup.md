### Theme Configuration

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#design-system-implementation]
The Gluestack UI theme must include:

- Ocean-inspired color palette with primary.500: '#0891b2' (dive blue)
- Surface colors: surface.50: '#f8fafc', surface.900: '#0f172a'
- Diving-specific colors: depth: '#1e40af', safety: '#dc2626', achievement: '#059669'
- 8px spacing system (1: '8px', 2: '16px', etc.)
- Inter font family for body and heading text

### Navigation Structure

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#navigation-routing]

- Use Expo Router with Stack and Tabs navigation
- Root layout with GluestackUIProvider and Stack navigation
- Tab layout with 5 tabs using lucide-react-native icons
- Tab bar styling: active color '#0891b2', inactive '#64748b', height 84px

### Supabase Integration

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

- Install @supabase/supabase-js 2.x for API client with auto-generated types
- Configure client in services/supabase.ts
- Set up environment variables for connection

### Testing Standards

No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs for this foundation story. The tech stack specifies Jest + Testing Library for unit tests and Maestro for E2E testing, but initial project setup should focus on getting the development environment running.

## Testing

- Verify project runs successfully on iOS simulator
- Verify project runs successfully on Android simulator
- Test navigation between all tab screens
- Verify Supabase client connection
- Test linting and formatting commands
- Confirm app builds without errors

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid foundation work with good adherence to React Native and Expo best practices. The developer successfully established a well-structured project with proper separation of concerns. The ocean-inspired theme implementation is clean and the navigation structure follows established patterns. Overall quality is production-ready for a project foundation story.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `services/supabase.ts`
  - **Change**: Added proper environment variable validation with descriptive error messages
  - **Why**: Prevents runtime crashes with unclear error messages when environment variables are missing
  - **How**: Replaced non-null assertion with explicit validation checks that throw meaningful errors

- **File**: `theme/config.ts`
  - **Change**: Added documentation comments explaining the design system purpose
  - **Why**: Improves maintainability and helps future developers understand the color choices
  - **How**: Added descriptive comments about the ocean-inspired design system

- **File**: `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
  - **Change**: Extracted hardcoded values to constants and improved imports
  - **Why**: Reduces magic numbers and improves maintainability across the application
  - **How**: Created constants file and imported values instead of inline strings/numbers

- **File**: `constants/index.ts` (Created)
  - **Change**: Centralized app configuration and design tokens
  - **Why**: Provides single source of truth for colors, spacing, and app metadata
  - **How**: Created structured constants with TypeScript const assertions for type safety

- **File**: `types/index.ts` (Created)
  - **Change**: Added foundational TypeScript interfaces for future development
  - **Why**: Establishes type safety patterns early in the project lifecycle
  - **How**: Created interfaces for User, DiveEntry, and ThemeColors with proper typing

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ ESLint passes with no errors, code follows TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches specified architecture with proper directory organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Foundation setup complete, ready for test implementation in next stories
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced Supabase client with proper error handling (services/supabase.ts)
- [x] Added TypeScript definitions for core entities (types/index.ts)
- [x] Centralized configuration constants (constants/index.ts)
- [x] Improved tab navigation with extracted constants (app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx)
- [x] Added design system documentation (theme/config.ts)
- [ ] Consider adding error boundary component for better error handling in future stories
- [ ] Add unit tests for Supabase client configuration validation in Epic 1.2
- [ ] Implement theme type safety with generated types from Gluestack UI

### Security Review

✅ **Approved** - Environment variable handling is secure with proper validation. No sensitive data exposed in client code. Supabase configuration follows security best practices with public environment variables only.

### Performance Considerations

✅ **Optimized** - Expo Router provides optimal code splitting. Theme configuration is lightweight. Tab navigation uses proper lazy loading. No performance concerns identified for foundation setup.

### Final Status

✅ **Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary:** Excellent foundation work with proper architecture, clean code, and good practices. The refactoring improvements enhance maintainability and type safety. Project is ready for Epic 1.2 (User Authentication System) development.
