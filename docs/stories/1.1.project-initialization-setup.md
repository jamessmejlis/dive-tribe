## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous story exists - this is the foundation story for the project.

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.3.3 for strong typing and React Native support
- **Mobile Framework**: React Native 0.73.x for cross-platform development
- **Development Platform**: Expo 50.x managed workflow for simplified deployment
- **UI Component Library**: Gluestack UI v2.x for universal, accessible components
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Supabase (latest) for database, auth, real-time, storage
- **Navigation**: Expo Router 3.x for file-based, type-safe routing
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier for consistent code style and quality

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#project-structure]
The project should follow this exact structure:

### Theme Configuration

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#design-system-implementation]
The Gluestack UI theme must include:

- Ocean-inspired color palette with primary.500: '#0891b2' (dive blue)
- Surface colors: surface.50: '#f8fafc', surface.900: '#0f172a'
- Diving-specific colors: depth: '#1e40af', safety: '#dc2626', achievement: '#059669'
- 8px spacing system (1: '8px', 2: '16px', etc.)
- Inter font family for body and heading text

### Navigation Structure

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#navigation-routing]

- Use Expo Router with Stack and Tabs navigation
- Root layout with GluestackUIProvider and Stack navigation
- Tab layout with 5 tabs using lucide-react-native icons
- Tab bar styling: active color '#0891b2', inactive '#64748b', height 84px

### Supabase Integration

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

- Install @supabase/supabase-js 2.x for API client with auto-generated types
- Configure client in services/supabase.ts
- Set up environment variables for connection

### Testing Standards

No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs for this foundation story. The tech stack specifies Jest + Testing Library for unit tests and Maestro for E2E testing, but initial project setup should focus on getting the development environment running.

## Testing

- Verify project runs successfully on iOS simulator
- Verify project runs successfully on Android simulator
- Test navigation between all tab screens
- Verify Supabase client connection
- Test linting and formatting commands
- Confirm app builds without errors
