### Tab Navigation Structure

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#tab-navigation]

**Updated Tab Configuration:**
```typescript
// app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx - Replace Challenges with Groups
<Tabs.Screen
  name="groups"  // Changed from "challenges"
  options={{
    title: 'Groups',
    tabBarIcon: ({ color }) => <Users size={24} color={color} />  // Changed icon
  }}
/>
```

**Icon Requirements:**
- Home: Home icon (existing)
- Discover: Search icon (existing)
- Log Dive: PlusCircle icon (existing)
- Groups: Users icon (new - replace Award icon)
- Profile: User icon (existing)

### Notification Settings Integration

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#push-notifications]

**Expo Notifications Configuration:**
```typescript
interface NotificationPreferences {
  dive_reminders: boolean
  social_notifications: boolean
  safety_alerts: boolean
  buddy_requests: boolean
  group_activities: boolean
  marketing_communications: boolean
}
```

**Permission Handling:**
- Request notification permissions on settings access
- Handle denied permissions gracefully with explanatory messaging
- Provide deep links to system settings for permission changes

### Privacy Controls Structure

[Source: architecture/authentication-security.md#privacy-controls]

**Privacy Settings from Architecture:**
- Granular Post Visibility: Public, Friends-only, Private (default: friends-only)
- Location Privacy: Optional GPS tagging with location fuzzing
- Profile Privacy: Configurable profile field visibility
- Activity Privacy: Option to hide specific dives or achievements

**Implementation Structure:**
```typescript
interface PrivacySettings {
  default_post_visibility: 'public' | 'friends' | 'private'
  location_sharing: 'exact' | 'fuzzy' | 'none'
  profile_visibility: {
    name: boolean
    bio: boolean
    certifications: boolean
    gear_list: boolean
    dive_stats: boolean
  }
  activity_privacy: {
    hide_personal_records: boolean
    hide_dive_locations: boolean
    hide_achievement_notifications: boolean
  }
}
```

### Account Management Features

**Logout Flow:**
- Confirmation dialog with "Are you sure?" messaging
- Clear all local storage and cached data
- Redirect to authentication flow
- Proper session cleanup with Supabase Auth

**Account Deletion Flow:**
```typescript
// Multi-step confirmation process
1. Initial deletion request with warning
2. Email verification step
3. Final confirmation with typed "DELETE" requirement
4. 30-day grace period with account suspension
5. Permanent deletion after grace period
```

**GDPR Data Export:**
```typescript
interface DataExport {
  user_profile: UserProfile
  dive_history: Dive[]
  posts: Post[]
  connections: Connection[]
  group_memberships: GroupMember[]
  settings: UserSettings
}
```

### State Management Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-with-zustand]

**Settings Store Structure:**
```typescript
interface SettingsState {
  notifications: NotificationPreferences
  privacy: PrivacySettings
  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
  loading: boolean
  updateNotifications: (prefs: Partial<NotificationPreferences>) => Promise<void>
  updatePrivacy: (settings: Partial<PrivacySettings>) => Promise<void>
  setTheme: (theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system') => void
  exportData: () => Promise<DataExport>
  deleteAccount: () => Promise<void>
}
```

### UI Component Standards

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-standards]

- Use Gluestack UI v2 components as base building blocks
- Follow ocean-inspired design system with dive blue (#0891b2) for primary actions
- Implement responsive design for mobile-first experience
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance with proper switch labels and descriptions
- Use consistent spacing and typography throughout settings screens
- Implement proper loading states and error handling for all settings operations

### Theme System Integration

**Gluestack UI v2 Theme Support:**
- Investigate built-in theme switching capabilities
- Implement theme detection from system preferences
- Store theme preference in user settings and persist locally
- Ensure theme changes apply immediately without app restart
- Handle theme-specific asset variations if needed

### Data Persistence Strategy

**Settings Storage:**
- Store notification and privacy preferences in user profile JSONB
- Cache theme preference locally for immediate application
- Sync settings changes with Supabase in real-time
- Handle offline settings changes with proper conflict resolution

### Testing Standards

Based on tech stack specification: Jest + Testing Library for unit tests and Maestro for E2E testing. Focus should be on testing navigation flows, settings persistence, notification permissions, privacy controls, and account management operations.

## Testing

- Test updated tab navigation with Groups tab replacing Challenges
- Test settings screen access from Profile tab

### 🔧 **RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS**

#### **Priority 1: Critical Dependencies**
```typescript
// ISSUE: Expo Notifications dependency missing
// IMPACT: Notification permission handling is mocked
// RECOMMENDATION: Add proper expo-notifications integration
npm install expo-notifications@~0.28.17 --legacy-peer-deps
```

#### **Priority 2: Settings Screen Logout Confirmation**
```typescript
// CURRENT: Direct logout without confirmation
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  // TODO: Add confirmation dialog
  await signOut()
}

// RECOMMENDED: Add confirmation dialog
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  Alert.alert(
    "Sign Out",
    "Are you sure you want to sign out?",
    [
      { text: "Cancel", style: "cancel" },
      { text: "Sign Out", onPress: async () => await signOut() }
    ]
  )
}
```

#### **Priority 3: Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
// RECOMMENDED: Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
const updateNotifications = async (prefs: Partial<NotificationPreferences>) => {
  const maxRetries = 3
  let attempt = 0
  
  while (attempt < maxRetries) {
    try {
      // existing implementation
      break
    } catch (error) {
      attempt++
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * attempt))
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Priority 4: Performance Optimization**
```typescript
// RECOMMENDED: Add debouncing for settings updates
import { debounce } from 'lodash'

const debouncedUpdatePrivacy = useMemo(
  () => debounce(updatePrivacy, 500),
  [updatePrivacy]
)
```
