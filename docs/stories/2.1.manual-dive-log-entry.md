### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#dive]

**Dive Entity Structure:**

- Purpose: Core activity tracking entity storing dive performance and metadata
- Key Attributes: id, user_id, depth, duration, location (GPS), dive_site, discipline, temperature, visibility, equipment, notes, photos, created_at
- Database schema: UUID id (PK), UUID user_id (FK), UUID dive_site_id (FK), decimal depth_meters, interval duration, geography location, string discipline, JSONB conditions, text notes, string[] photo_urls, timestamp dive_time

**Dive JSONB Conditions Structure:**

```typescript
interface DiveConditions {
  environment: 'ocean' | 'pool'
  water_temperature?: number
  visibility?: number // meters, ocean only
  current_strength?: string // ocean only
  surface_conditions?: string // ocean only
  pool_length?: number // pool only
}

interface DivePerformanceMetrics {
  depth_meters?: number // for depth disciplines
  duration_seconds?: number // for static/time-based
  distance_meters?: number // for dynamic disciplines
  heart_rate_max?: number // if available
  surface_interval_seconds?: number
}
```

### API Integration

[Source: architecture/api-architecture.md#dive-management]

**Dive Management Endpoints (handled by Supabase):**

```typescript
POST /rest/v1/dives - Log new dive
GET /rest/v1/dives?user_id=eq.{userId} - Get user's dive history
PUT /rest/v1/dives?id=eq.{diveId} - Update dive details
POST /storage/v1/object/dive-photos/{diveId}/{photoIndex} - Upload dive photos
GET /storage/v1/object/public/dive-photos/{diveId} - Get dive photo URLs
```

**External API Requirements:**

- Expo Location API for GPS coordinate capture
- Expo ImagePicker for photo selection from camera/gallery
- Supabase Storage for dive photo upload and management

  submitDive: (dive: Partial<Dive>) => Promise<void>
  uploadPhotos: (photos: string[]) => Promise<string[]>
  getCurrentLocation: () => Promise<LocationCoordinates>
  syncOfflineDives: () => Promise<void>
}
```

### UI Component Standards

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-standards]

- Use Gluestack UI v2 components as base building blocks
- Follow ocean-inspired design system with dive blue (#0891b2) for primary actions
- Implement responsive design for mobile-first experience
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance with proper form labels and error handling
- Use centralized constants for dive disciplines and performance metrics
- Implement proper loading states and offline indicators

### Form Validation Requirements

**Dive Form Validation Rules:**

- Environment: Required selection between 'ocean' and 'pool'
- Dive site name: Required for ocean dives, 2-100 characters
- Pool name/location: Required for pool dives, 2-100 characters
- Date/time: Required, cannot be future date
- Maximum depth: Required for ocean dives, 0.1-330m range
- Duration: Required based on discipline type
- Distance: Required for dynamic disciplines, 1-300m range
- Discipline: Required selection from predefined list
- Performance metrics: Validated based on discipline and world records
- Photos: Max 5 images, 10MB total, JPEG/PNG only
- Notes: Optional, max 2000 characters

### File Storage Implementation

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#file-storage]

**Supabase Storage Integration:**

- S3-compatible API for dive photo uploads
- CDN delivery for optimized image loading
- Built-in image transformations for photo optimization
- File naming convention: `dive-photos/{diveId}/{timestamp}-{index}.{extension}`
- File size limits: 5MB per photo, 10MB total per dive
- Automatic image compression to 1920x1080 max resolution

### Offline Capabilities

**Offline Dive Logging:**

- Store draft dives in device storage using AsyncStorage
- Queue completed dives for upload when connection restored
- Cache dive sites and disciplines for offline access
- Sync pending uploads automatically on connectivity
- Handle photo uploads separately from dive data sync

### Testing Standards

Based on tech stack specification: Jest + Testing Library for unit tests and Maestro for E2E testing. Focus should be on testing form validation, photo upload functionality, offline sync, location services, and integration with existing stores.

## Testing

- Test form validation for all required and optional fields
- Test draft save functionality and persistence
- Test offline mode and sync capabilities
- Test successful dive submission and confirmation
- Test integration with existing navigation and profile systems
- Test error handling for network failures and validation errors
