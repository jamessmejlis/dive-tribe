## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:
- Supabase client is already configured in `services/supabase.ts` with proper environment variable validation
- Gluestack UI theme is set up with ocean-inspired colors (#0891b2 dive blue)
- Navigation structure exists with Expo Router and proper tab layout
- TypeScript interfaces are established in `types/index.ts` with User interface
- Constants are centralized in `constants/index.ts` for consistent styling

### Tech Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (Latest) for user authentication service with OAuth providers, session management, RLS integration
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4.x for lightweight state management with simple API and TypeScript support
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form 7.48.x for form validation and management with performance optimization
- **UI Components**: Gluestack UI v2.x for universal, accessible components with built-in form elements
- **Navigation**: Expo Router 3.x for file-based, type-safe routing with auth flow navigation

### Authentication Architecture

[Source: architecture/authentication-security.md#authentication-flow]

**Authentication Providers:**
- Email/Password: Traditional signup with email verification
- Google OAuth: Streamlined social login
- Apple OAuth: Required for iOS App Store compliance
- Anonymous Sessions: Guest browsing with upgrade prompts (not in this story)

**Session Management Implementation:**
```typescript
// Automatic token refresh pattern
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  if (event === 'SIGNED_IN') {
    AuthStore.setSession(session)
  }
  if (event === 'TOKEN_REFRESHED') {
    AuthStore.updateSession(session)
  }
})
```

### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#project-structure]

**Authentication screens location:**
```
app/(auth)/                  # Authentication flow
├── login.tsx
├── register.tsx
└── onboarding.tsx
```

**Authentication service location:**
```
services/
├── supabase.ts            # Already exists - Supabase client
└── auth.service.ts        # New - Authentication service wrapper
```

**State management location:**
```
stores/
└── auth.store.ts          # New - User authentication store
```

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]

**User Entity:**
- Purpose: Central entity representing divers with profiles, preferences, and authentication
- Key Attributes: id, email, profile (name, bio, certifications, gear), privacy_settings, location, diving_goals
- Database schema: UUID id (PK), string email, JSONB profile, JSONB privacy_settings, geography location, timestamp created_at

### State Management Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-with-zustand]

**Authentication Store Structure:**
```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null
  session: Session | null
  loading: boolean
  signIn: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>
  signUp: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>
  signOut: () => Promise<void>
  setSession: (session: Session | null) => void
}
```

### UI Component Standards  

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-standards]

- Use Gluestack UI v2 components as base building blocks
- Follow ocean-inspired design system with dive blue (#0891b2) for primary actions
- Implement responsive design for mobile-first experience
- Ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance with proper form labels and error handling
- Use centralized constants from `constants/index.ts` for colors and spacing

### API Integration

[Source: architecture/api-architecture.md#restful-endpoints]

**Authentication Flow Endpoints (handled by Supabase Auth):**
```typescript
POST /auth/signup - Create new user account
POST /auth/signin - Authenticate user  
POST /auth/signout - Invalidate session
GET /auth/user - Get current user profile
```

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/authentication-security.md#security-measures]

- Row Level Security (RLS): Database-level access control
- Input Validation: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- Data Encryption: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Secure token storage with automatic refresh handling
- Proper error messaging without exposing sensitive information

### Testing Standards

No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs for authentication flows. The tech stack specifies Jest + Testing Library for unit tests and Maestro for E2E testing. Focus should be on testing authentication flows, error scenarios, and state management.

## Testing

- Test email registration with verification email sending
- Test email sign-in with valid and invalid credentials
- Test Google OAuth flow on both iOS and Android simulators
- Test Apple Sign-In flow on iOS simulator  
- Test password reset email functionality
- Test session persistence across app restarts
- Test error handling for network failures and invalid inputs
- Test loading states during authentication operations
- Verify navigation flow between authentication screens
- Test automatic token refresh functionality
